### About Me
I am a PhD student in Economics at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/academic-experience/students/daniel-chen). 

#### I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market. 


My primary research fields are microeconomic theory and finance. I am interested in problems related to market structure, dynamic games, mechanism design, and the strategic avoidance of price impact.
